## Here is the random stuff

##### Brief Information of the dataset used.

Number of **Rows** in the Merged dataset of `Recipes` and `Interactions` is
**234429**

Columns Explanation for Data Analysis

`id` : it shows unique identification code for each recipe.

`description` : The column where the provider of the recipes explains about the recipes. We can learn what we are expecting from the recipe and its cooking process. This column is very useful when you never heard of the name of the recipes.

`review` : The column where people who tried the recipe wrote comments about how they felt about the recipe personally. It is a good data to see how people think differently about the same recipe and get more detailed information which `description` column does not contain.

`rating` : The column which contains people's opinion of the recipe in numeric values from 1 to 5. We analyze the people's judgement on the recipes in numeric value which would make the comparison between recipes easier. Sometimes it is hard to judge by just looking at the recipes and description.

Above four columns are the data that we use to test the question we have.
We want to see if `description` and `review` columns contain exclamation marks or not. Also, we need corresponding ratings for each reviews and descriptions.

## Cleaning and EDA

### Data Cleaning

The datasets that Zichen and Hyunsoo are using unfortunately have issues. In order to make a precise analysis, they had to look closely on each column and check if there is any problem before they use.

Below are the steps that they have taken to get their data set ready for analyzation.

#### Merging `interactions` and `recipes`

Zichen and Hyunsoo realized that `Interactions` dataset contains information for the individual recipes in `recipes` dataset. They wanted to look at all the information at the same time, so they decided to merge two data. Both data had common data in columnd `id` and `recipe_id` which indicated id for the individual recipes. So they decided to merge the datasets on common `id` column. They did not want to lose all the reviews that `interactions` dataset contains in the process of merging, so they generated more rows based on the number of rows in `interactions` dataset.

    merged_df = pd.merge(recipes,interactions,left_on = 'id',
                     right_on = 'recipe_id',how = 'left')

#### Because there is "\n" in the `review` and `description`, the dataframe in the markdown is ruined, so we need to get rid of them.

Hyunsoo finds that so merged_df only have review for one whole row, which is very odd. Hyunsoo look at the dataframe closely and finds there is "\n" and they decide to get rid of them with str.replace method.

    merged_df['review'] = merged_df['review'].str.replace("\n","")
    merged_df['description'] = merged_df['description'].str.replace("\n","")

Here is how `merged_df` look like:

| name                               |     id | review                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| 1 in canada chocolate chip cookies | 453467 | Originally I was gonna cut the recipe in half (just the 2 of us here), but then we had a park-wide yard sale, & I made the whole batch & used them as enticements for potential buyers ~ what the hey, a free cookie as delicious as these are, definitely works its magic! Will be making these again, for sure! Thanks for posting the recipe!                                                                                                                                | this is the recipe that we use at my school cafeteria for chocolate chip cookies. they must be the best chocolate chip cookies i have ever had! if you don't have margarine or don't like it, then just use butter (softened) instead.                                                                                                                                           |
| 412 broccoli casserole             | 306168 | This was one of the best broccoli casseroles that I have ever made. I made my own chicken soup for this recipe. I was a bit worried about the tsp of soy sauce but it gave the casserole the best flavor. YUM! The photos you took (shapeweaver) inspired me to make this recipe and it actually does look just like them when it comes out of the oven. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe shapeweaver. It was wonderful! Going into my family's favorite Zaar cookbook :) | since there are already 411 recipes for broccoli casserole posted to "zaar" ,i decided to call this one #412 broccoli casserole.i don't think there are any like this one in the database. i based this one on the famous "green bean casserole" from campbell's soup. but i think mine is better since i don't like cream of mushroom soup.submitted to "zaar" on may 28th,2008 |

| 412 broccoli casserole             | 306168 | Loved this. Be sure to completely thaw the broccoli. I didn&#039;t and it didn&#039;t get done in time specified. Just cooked it a little longer though and it was perfect. Thanks Chef.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | since there are already 411 recipes for broccoli casserole posted to "zaar" ,i decided to call this one #412 broccoli casserole.i don't think there are any like this one in the database. i based this one on the famous "green bean casserole" from campbell's soup. but i think mine is better since i don't like cream of mushroom soup.submitted to "zaar" on may 28th,2008 |

if you compare the dataframe created in the merging step and getting read of line changer step, you can observe that the columns with just reviews are gone.

#### Change 0 in rating columns to NaN

There is some "unfaithful" data in the `rating` column that present as 0, so Zichen decide to change all of 0 in the rating to NaN. Having 0 in `rating` is "unfaithful", because when the users put ratings, zero is not an option. If the users have put the rating correctly, the rating should be in between 1 to 5. So, having 0 instead does not make sence. So in this step, we replaced the 0 to null value.

    merged_df.loc[merged_df['rating'] == 0, 'rating'] = np.nan

How `merged_df` look like after cleaning:

| name                               |     id | rating |
| :--------------------------------- | -----: | -----: |
| 1 brownies in the world best ever  | 333281 |      4 |
| 1 in canada chocolate chip cookies | 453467 |      5 |
| 412 broccoli casserole             | 306168 |      5 |
| 412 broccoli casserole             | 306168 |      5 |
| 412 broccoli casserole             | 306168 |      5 |

#### Average rating for each recipe

Zichen thinks that average rating is a very useful information to find. So he use the groupby method to find each recipes' average rating and add that data to the `res` dataframe.

    mean_df = pd.DataFrame(merged_df.groupby("id")['rating'].mean())
    res = pd.merge(merged_df, mean_df,left_on = 'id',right_index = True,how = 'inner',)
    res = res.rename(columns = {"rating_y" : "Average Rating", "rating_x" : "rating"})

How tail of `res` look like after cleaning:

| name                                       |     id | rating | Average Rating |
| :----------------------------------------- | -----: | -----: | -------------: |
| zydeco ya ya deviled eggs                  | 308080 |      5 |              5 |
| cookies by design cookies on a stick       | 298512 |      1 |              1 |
| cookies by design sugar shortbread cookies | 298509 |      1 |              3 |
| cookies by design sugar shortbread cookies | 298509 |      5 |              3 |
| cookies by design sugar shortbread cookies | 298509 |    nan |              3 |

Above is the result of changing 0 rating to null value and adding average rating column steps. If you look at the last row the rating contains null value instead of zero.

#### Adding Total number of ! from reviews and description column to res

Hyunsoo remebers that the question they decide to investgate related to the number of ! appears in the `description` and `review` columns, so he decide to add a new column `Total_#!` to the `res` dataframe

    res['Total_#!'] = res['review'].str.count("!") + res['description'].str.count("!")

How `res` look like after cleaning:

| name                               |     id | Total\_#! |
| :--------------------------------- | -----: | --------: |
| 1 brownies in the world best ever  | 333281 |         4 |
| 1 in canada chocolate chip cookies | 453467 |         4 |
| 412 broccoli casserole             | 306168 |         2 |
| 412 broccoli casserole             | 306168 |         1 |
| 412 broccoli casserole             | 306168 |         0 |

#### Get rid of outliers from n_steps and minutes columns

When Zichen want to check what recipe takes the longest time to make, he surprisingly find out that it takes 1051200 minutes to make. Zichen thinks that is definitely an outlier for the later test, so he decides to remove some outlier like these in the minutes and n_steps. He set the threshold to only include the recipes which takes less than or equal to 30 steps to make and takes minutes which is less than or equal to 800 minutes.

    res = res[res['minutes'] < 800]
    res = res[res['n_steps'] <= 30]

This is how res look like after cleaning:

| name                               |     id | minutes | n_steps |
| :--------------------------------- | -----: | ------: | ------: |
| 1 brownies in the world best ever  | 333281 |      40 |      10 |
| 1 in canada chocolate chip cookies | 453467 |      45 |      12 |
| 412 broccoli casserole             | 306168 |      40 |       6 |
| 412 broccoli casserole             | 306168 |      40 |       6 |
| 412 broccoli casserole             | 306168 |      40 |       6 |

#### Clean the nutrition column into seperate columns, such as "[calories (#), total fat (PDV), sugar (PDV), sodium (PDV), protein (PDV), saturated fat (PDV), and carbohydrates (PDV)]"

Hyunsoo finds that the `nutrition` which represent calories, total fat, sugar, sodium, protein, saturated fat, and carbohydrates, was express as object type in the `res` so he decide to split nutrition into 7 different new columns and include these columns in the `res`.

    cur = res['nutrition'].str[1:-1].str.split(',')
    res['calories'] = cur.str[0].astype(float)
    res['fat'] = cur.str[1].astype(float)
    res['sugar'] = cur.str[2].astype(float)
    res['sodium'] = cur.str[3].astype(float)
    res['protein'] = cur.str[4].astype(float)
    res['s_fat'] = cur.str[5].astype(float)
    res['carb'] = cur.str[6].astype(float)
    res['rating'] = merged_df['rating'].astype(float)
    res = res.drop(columns = 'nutrition')

Here is how `res` look like after cleaning:

| name                               |     id | calories | fat | sugar | sodium | protein | s_fat | carb | rating |
| :--------------------------------- | -----: | -------: | --: | ----: | -----: | ------: | ----: | ---: | -----: |
| 1 brownies in the world best ever  | 333281 |    138.4 |  10 |    50 |      3 |       3 |    19 |    6 |      4 |
| 1 in canada chocolate chip cookies | 453467 |    595.1 |  46 |   211 |     22 |      13 |    51 |   26 |      5 |

#### Change empty list in tags column to NaN

Hyunsoo is a careful student, he finds out that there are also unfaithful data appears in the tags, which represent as empty list, so he decide to replace them as NAN.

    res['tags'].replace("['']",np.nan,inplace = True)

Here is how dataset looks like after cleaning:

| name                               |     id | tags                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
